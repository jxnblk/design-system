# Where to add a new component

Problem: You want to add a new component to the Design System.
The decision you have to make is where to add the component to the project.

## Options

There are two places a component could be added to the Design System. The first one is `/packages/core`, also called `core`.

The other option is to create a new package, `/packages/my-new-component`.

## Considerations

- expected usage and nature of the component
- bundle size
- DS upgrade process

### Expected Usage

In general, all of the components in `/packages/core` are primitives: they are building blocks for use in constructing more complex UI elements. Packages that exist outside of `/packages/core`, like `/packages/autocomplete`, `/packages/modal` and `/packages/slider` are more complex units of the user interface.

### Bundle Size

Most JavaScript projects can take advantage of tree-shaking. Tree-shaking is an optimization performed by a bundler (like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)) to eliminate dead or unused code at build time. It is done by statically analyzing the source code and looking for exports in included packages that are not imported by the application. From the documentation of [Webpack: Tree-Shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#root):

> Tree-shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax, indicated by keywords like `import` and `export`. The name and concept were popularized by the ES2015 module bundler [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).

Each package in the monorepo is built with [Babel CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli), with exports of `dist/cjs/index.js` for CommonJS and `dist/esm/index.js` for ES Modules. Modern bundling tools like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) can perform tree-shaking on ES Modules exports.

### Design System Upgrade Process

There is an advantage to using a discrete package for a new component. While migrating between major releases of Design System, packages can be used alongside supported versions of Design System. Developers should be able to use components immediately, without being blocked by needing to perform a semver major upgrade first.

## Naming

Naming is one of the hardest things a developer does daily. Props and components should have expressive, descriptive names.
