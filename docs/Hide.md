# Hide

A Box component extension to set `display: none` between specific breakpoints.
This component's props work differently than other mobile-first min-width
media queries since it's often useful to hide an element only at certain breakpoints.

```.jsx
[
  // Hidden below the first breakpoint
  <Hide xs>
    Hide xs
  </Hide>,
  // Hidden at large breakpoints
  <Hide lg xl>
    Hide lg xl
  </Hide>
]
```

Prop | Type | Description
---|---|---
xs | boolean | sets display: none below the sm breakpoint
sm | boolean | sets display: none between the sm and md breakpoint
md | boolean | sets display: none between the md and lg breakpoint
lg | boolean | sets display: none between the lg and xl breakpoint
xl | boolean | sets display: none above the xl breakpoint
