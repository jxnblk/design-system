# This workflow is to create a baseline for comparison in PRs via Chromatic
# It is necessary due to our `Squash and merge` strategy, where the head commit changes and
# Chromatic doesn't have a proper ref to compare changes to.
# See https://www.chromatic.com/docs/ci#github-squash-rebase-merge-and-the-master-branch for more information
