            Images are graphical user interface elements used to display images on a website. Images are a key
            component of many websites, and they can serve a variety of purposes, such as providing visual
            interest, showcasing products or services, or conveying important information.

              There are several ways to incorporate images into a website's UI. One common approach is to use
              images as part of the components layout, such as by including a banner image at the top of the
              page or using images to break up text blocks. Another approach is to use images as part of
              individual content items, such as including product images on an e-commerce website or using
              images to illustrate articles. It is important to consider factors such as image size and
              resolution, placement and alignment within the page layout, and accessibility for users with
              disabilities. It's also important to optimize images for web use in order to ensure fast loading
              times and good performance on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Overall, effective website
              image UI can help to enhance the user experience and communicate important information to
              website visitors.

              CSS images and background images are both used to display images on a website, but there are
              some key differences between the two. A CSS image is an image that is inserted directly into the
              content of an HTML page using the &lt;img&gt; tag. CSS can be used to apply styling to the
              image, such as setting the width and height, adjusting the position, or adding borders and
              effects. A background image, on the other hand, is an image that is used as the background for
              an HTML element, such as a div or a section. The image is specified using CSS, and can be
              positioned and sized in a variety of ways. Background images are often used to add visual
              interest to a webpage or to provide a backdrop for other content. One of the main differences
              between CSS images and background images is how they are treated by search engines and screen
              readers. CSS images inserted using the &lt;img&gt; tag are more likely to be recognized by
              search engines and are more accessible to screen readers, as they are considered part of the
              content of the page. Background images, on the other hand, are often ignored by search engines
              and may not be accessible to users with visual impairments. Another difference between the two
              is the way they are loaded. CSS images are loaded as separate files, which can slow down the
              page loading time if there are too many of them. Overall, both CSS images and background images
              have their own strengths and weaknesses, and their use depends on the specific needs and goals
              of a website.

              Responsive layouts will impact how an image will fill a parent element or page. When placing an
              image within an object it is important to choose images that work well at different extremes for
              width. When cropping is likely, keep important content in view at any width.

            <Text.p textStyle='paragraph'>
              When setting the width and hight of an image, it's important to consider all use cases. Forcing
              images into the same width and or height can cause unwanted stretching. Using image API services
              is one way to deliver consistent image crops. Manually exporting images to control cropping is
              another option. However allowing admin control of how the image displays with object-fit on a
              per use bases is the most optimal option to control outcome.
