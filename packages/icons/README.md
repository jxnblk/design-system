Priceline React icons based on Material Design Icons

```

## Usage

For a complete list of all icons, see:

## Development

Most of the icons are generated from [material-design-icons][]
and converted to React components with [pixo][].
Custom icon SVGs are included in the `icons/` directory.

To build the icons locally, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Run tests:

```sh
npm test
```

To build for publishing:

```sh
npm run prepare
```
